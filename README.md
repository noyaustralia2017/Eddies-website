# Design Idea for St Edmund's College Canberra website
St Edmund's College Canberra (sec.act.edu.au) was looking to update their website and wanted some design ideas of what the future website can look like. This website is an example design idea that can be incorporated into the website.  This was done as an assignment in 2019 and uses the Bootstrap framework.
